## About This Portfolio
* This website is fully responsive and designed with a mobile-first approach. I created this website to showcase some of my skills and to feature my previous projects that I have created. You can find a wide range of projects on my portfolio, including web development, graphic design, and terminal projects. I put a lot of effort and time into creating a user-friendly and visually appealing design that is easy to navigate. If you're interested in learning more about me and my work, I would love for you to check out my website by clicking on the link provided ![Arminas Portfolio](url). Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you're interested in working together on a project.
